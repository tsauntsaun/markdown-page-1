**Flight of the Pelicans**  
*"write a poem about the new orleans pelicans"* - me 

Down by the Bayou, where the city hums and beats,  
Where the rhythm of the court meets the jazz of the streets,  
The Pelicans rise, proud and bold,  
A flock of young talent, both fierce and untold.  

Zion roars, a force in flight,  
Leaping high, a thunderous sight.  
With power unmatched, his slam dunks rain,  
A star of the swamp, through joy and through pain.  

Then there's Ingram, long and lean,  
A silken shot, a scoring machine.  
With wings stretched wide, he glides so free,  
Painting points like art, for all to see.  

CJ brings the wisdom, a veteran’s grace,  
Guiding the young ones, setting the pace.  
Through fast breaks and pressure, calm in the storm,  
A rock in the chaos, the steady, the warm.  

Herb Jones on defense, a shadow that stings,  
Locking down threats, clipping their wings.  
Quick as lightning, nimble and strong,  
He guards the flock all season long.  

Alvarado, the spark, relentless and quick,  
Stealing the ball with moves so slick.  
With heart and hustle, his spirit soars,  
Fueling the team, igniting the floor.  

In New Orleans, they rise, against all odds,  
With dreams in their hearts and strength from the gods.  
So here’s to the Pelicans, soaring high,  
A team of grit, of heart, of sky.
